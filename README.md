## Testing Framework
### Notes:
<strong> To be easy to separate production code from test classes, later ones can be put in packages that are different the production ones</strong>
<strong> But for this project test classes are in the same production classes </strong>

# Run Test cases from command line
` java -jar src/test/libs/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.0.3.jar -d src/test/` 
from project root directory.
