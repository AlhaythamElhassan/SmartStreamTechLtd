Context

	According to the requirement given in file Software Engineer-Java Assessment.docx that
	trigger the development of an application in the attached archive zipped folder application.zip.  

Objective

	Following objectives partially achieved starting form a given database that contains
	tables (PERSON and ORDER) and a JDBC library (JDBC + Driver = API on top of database)
	by implementing:
		- Create, Retrieve, Update, and Drop (CRUD) service layer that abstract
		  functionality of the (JDBC + database driver) API and decouple the 
		  application  direct dependency on database service. (Implemented not tested)
		- Service layer that read records from file with different
		   delimiters (`,` and `|`) (Implemented and tested).
		- Service layer that do filtering operations on the retrieve collection from 
		  database as described in Software Engineer-Java Assessment.docx. (Implemented not tested)
Outputs

	Please follow read me to run the application. All the features were implemented but not all tested.
	
outcome

The application meets the all functional requirements but not all non-functional ones. Requirements that are not met are:
	- Complete unit testing
	- Documentation
	- Fully code refactoring and decoupling as much as possible.
	- The level of abstraction.
	- Consistent code styling (linting).
	- Considering a prober TDD or BDD or even both.  

Notes:
	- After each objective there is a flag that show the status of the objective (i.e. implemented,
	 tested, not implemented, not tested or any combination of former status')
	- project developed using Eclipse IDE, Gradle automation build tool, local git remotely hosted by GitHub and
	  continuous integration server hosted by CircleCi.
